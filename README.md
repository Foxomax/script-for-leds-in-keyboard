This script is created with the purpose of solving a problem that some keyboards have, since when you press their corresponding button they do not turn on the leds. I don't know if it works for all keyboards, so far the ones that do work are the following: 
1. TF-560 (The Wolf 560)

To use the script you must first copy To use the script you must first copy the repository, you can do it with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Foxomax/script-for-leds-in-keyboard.git
```
Then navigate to the folder, you can do it using the following command:
```bash
cd script-for-leds-in-keyboard
```
Then you must run the script and it will do its magic:
```bash
sudo bash scripLeds.sh
```
If you have problems, it means that the route does not exist and you can place it manually. The current problem is that if the route exists but is not the correct one, it still cannot be changed manually.
In future patches we will comply with this.
